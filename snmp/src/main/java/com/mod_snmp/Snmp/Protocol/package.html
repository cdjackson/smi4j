The SNMP protocol stack.

The package is the core of the SNMP protocol implementation and
is used by the Snmp.Manager package. It is designed according the
SNMP architecture framework as a multilingual SNMP protocol engine.

<P>The protocol versions supported are:<BR>
<LI>SNMP version 1</LI>
<LI>SNMP version 2 community based (2C)</LI>
<LI>SNMP version 3, only the security level, privacy, is not implemented</LI>
</P>

<P>The following security models are implemented:<BR>
<LI>Community, used in SNMP version 1, 2C and 3.</LI>
<LI>User based Security Model (USM) RFC XXXX</LI>
</P>
NOTE: The community based security model for SNMP version 3 
	may be either model 1 or 2. However, it is probably
	not supported by many SNMP agents and it is neither
	an security replacement for the SNMP versions 1 and 2C.
