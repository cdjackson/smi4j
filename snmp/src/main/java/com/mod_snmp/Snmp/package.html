The SNMP management application toolkit.
</H1>
<P>
A typical SNMP manager is used to implement business logic that can retrieve
management information from remote devices in order to provide a coherent view
of the current status of the device or the associations between mutliple devices.
This can assist bussiness with a single point of overviewing its network, services
and systems it is made of. It can even help people to automate tasks and
makes operational changes to improve a current device as well temporarly
shutting services down.
</P>
<P>
All devices and services can be different, but need a common interface to the
management interface that is the SNMP agent. The SNMP agent is the maintainer of
a virtual store of the management information store. Its information is grouped
and order by a Management Information Base (MIB) that mostly is composed of
modules.

<P>
This toolkit can be used to built a JAVA based management application
able to retrieve and set management data.
